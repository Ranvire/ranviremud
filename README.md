# Ranvire (RanvierMUD Discovery Fork)

**NB / TL;DR:** This is a discovery fork; a maintenance-focused modernization effort related to Ranvier lives at **[https://github.com/Ranvire/ranviermud](https://github.com/Ranvire/ranviermud)**.

This repository is a **discovery fork** of the original [RanvierMUD](https://github.com/RanvierMUD/ranviermud) project.

It exists to remain visible in the upstream fork network and to point interested users to a separate effort focused on modernizing and stabilizing the Ranvier engine.

## Related project: Ranvire

A separate project, **Ranvire**, is working on a maintenance-focused modernization of Ranvier, including:

- updating the runtime to modern Node.js
- adding CI and smoke tests
- fixing long-standing crashes and sharp edges
- restoring a reliable out-of-the-box experience

That work lives here:

👉 **https://github.com/Ranvire/ranviermud**

## Purpose of this fork

This fork is intentionally minimal and is not intended to be an active development repository. It exists for discoverability and to help people find related maintenance work happening elsewhere.

If you are looking to experiment with Ranvier or follow ongoing maintenance efforts, please see the Ranvire repository linked above.

## Upstream respect

This fork does not claim ownership of the RanvierMUD project. If the original maintainers are interested in reviewing or merging maintenance improvements, that discussion is welcome.
