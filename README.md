# Ranvire (RanvierMUD Discovery Fork)

This repository is a **discovery fork** for the original [RanvierMUD](https://github.com/RanvierMUD/ranviermud) project, pointing to an active maintenance project [RanvireMUD](https://github.com/Ranvire/ranviermud)

This repo exists to remain visible in the upstream fork network and to point interested users to this separate effort focused on modernizing and stabilizing the Ranvier engine, including:

- updating the runtime to modern Node.js
- adding CI and smoke tests
- fixing long-standing crashes and sharp edges
- restoring a reliable out-of-the-box experience

That work lives here:

👉 **https://github.com/Ranvire/ranviermud**

## Purpose of this repository

This repository fork is intentionally minimal. It exists for discoverability, to help people find the actively maintained MUD project.

If you are looking to experiment with Ranvier or follow ongoing maintenance efforts, please see the Ranvire repository linked above.

## Upstream respect

This fork does not claim ownership of the RanvierMUD project. If the original maintainers are interested in reviewing or merging maintenance improvements, they are more than welcome, and I am happy to help.
